# TimeGEBM

This is the code for my MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning thesis at UCL. In this project I develop two generalized energy based models[1] for time-series generation. The first extends the attention-based GAN TTS-GAN[2] and the second the recurrent-based GAN C-RNN-GAN[3]. The report can be found in the report.pdf file. Credit has been given where external code has been utilised.
