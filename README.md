# Time-GEBM

This is the code for my MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning thesis at UCL. In this project I develop two generalized energy based models[1] for time-series generation. The first extends the attention-based GAN TTS-GAN[2] and the second the recurrent-based GAN C-RNN-GAN[3]. The report can be found in the report.pdf file. Credit has been given where external code has been utilised.



## Introduction

This repository contains the work for my MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning thesis at UCL. In this project I develop two [**Generalized Energy Based Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05033) for time-series generation. The first extends the attention-based GAN [**TTS-GAN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02691) and the second the recurrent-based GAN [**C-RNN-GAN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09904). The report can be found in the report.pdf file.
